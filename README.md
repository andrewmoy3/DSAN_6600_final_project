## **Introduction**

With the rapid advancement of technology, the healthcare industry has been able to capture and analyze more data than ever before.Among imaging modalities, **X-rays remain one of the most widely used diagnostic tools**, utilizing high-energy electromagnetic radiation that penetrates tissue at varying degrees. This allows clinicians to visualize internal anatomical structures, particularly dense regions such as bone, and identify conditions like fractures, infections, and pulmonary abnormalities without invasive procedures.

Modern hospitals nowadays collect large thoracic imaging data. With the progress of machine learning and deep learning architectures, these datasets can be leveraged to **automate the detection and classification of thoracic diseases**, significantly improving efficiency and faster clinical decision-making.

This project analyzesa total of **108,948 frontal-view chest X-ray images from 32,717 unique patients**, provided by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), to classify the following eight common thoracic findings:

- **Atelectasis**  
- **Cardiomegaly**  
- **Effusion**  
- **Infiltration**  
- **Mass**  
- **Nodule**  
- **Pneumonia**  
- **Pneumothorax**

For reference, Pneumonia alone accounted for **41,210 deaths in the United States in 2023**, corresponding to a mortality rate of **12.3 deaths per 100,000 people**, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

## **Project Objective**

The goal of this project is to develop a **well-documented Python framework** that applies advanced deep learning models to accurately classify the aforementioned thoracic conditions. We evaluate and compare **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transformer-based architectures** to determine the most effective model for this task. This system is intended to support researchers and medical professionals by providing a **free, accessible, and adaptable tool** for identifying thoracic abnormalities in chest X-ray images.
